## The framing

Design variables change like APIs. If the naming, structure, or type changes, downstream teams need a clear signal about impact. SemVer gives designers and engineers the same shared language for change.

### Contract shape

A contract is just a typed payload with a schema version and a contract version. The version tells teams whether a change is safe, risky, or breaking.

```json
{
  "contractVersion": "1.4.0",
  "schemaVersion": "2025.10",
  "source": "design",
  "publishedAt": "2026-01-15",
  "tokens": {
    "color.brand.primary": {
      "type": "color",
      "value": "#4ea1ff"
    }
  }
}
```

### Release rules

- MAJOR: rename or remove a token, or change its type.
- MINOR: add new tokens or new variants that do not break existing usage.
- PATCH: adjust values without touching structure.

### Governance payoff

When tokens are versioned like code, you can audit changes, validate compatibility in CI, and roll back without guesswork. It turns variable drift into a predictable release cycle.

## Why I use it

This keeps design, engineering, and product aligned. The spec does not just document the change, it explains the impact in a language every team already understands.

## Intent

I wanted navigation to feel like a tool, not a page swap. The terminal overlay buys a beat so the motion reads, the command feels intentional, and the transition does not eat scroll position or analytics.

### Why a terminal

The terminal metaphor is the closest thing to my everyday state. It also signals that the site is a system, not just a gallery. The goal was to make routing feel like an action, not a flash.

### Motion language

- Fast fade in, slower fade out so the content arrival feels deliberate.
- A single command line as the focal point to avoid noisy overlays.
- Minimal color accents so the content remains the star.

## Implementation notes

### Transition handshake

The page does not navigate until the terminal animation reaches its peak. That gives motion time to land while still keeping the route change honest.

```ts
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'
import { useTransitionStore } from '@/store/transition-store'

export const useTerminalLink = () => {
  const router = useRouter()
  const startTransition = useTransitionStore((state) => state.startTransition)

  return (href: string) => {
    startTransition(href, () => router.push(href), href)
  }
}
```

### Guardrails

- If the user clicks the same route, skip the transition.
- If a transition stalls, force navigation and clear the state.
- Respect hash links so in-page navigation stays instant.

### The intent behind the choices

The overlay exists to make the click feel like a command, not to slow the user down. It is about giving the UI a confident cadence while still keeping scroll and analytics consistent.

## What I would improve next

- Preload the next route while the terminal animates.
- Add a short transition preset for hash links.
- Expose a tiny API so sections can register their own transition copy.

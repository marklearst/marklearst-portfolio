**♿️ a11y Companion v2.0.0 is live.**

If you want to track WCAG work inside Figma and FigJam, without spreadsheet theater, this is for you.

Source checklist: [The A11Y Project](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/). Standards target: [W3C WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).

## The part most tools skip

**Most contrast tools lie by omission.**

They show a ratio. They give you AA or AAA. They rarely tell you what they cannot evaluate.

When building the Contrast Inspector for v2, I made a deliberate choice: only support what can be evaluated honestly.

- **Supported:**
  - solid on solid
  - solid on single gradient
  - single gradient on solid
- **Explicitly unsupported:**
  - dual gradients
  - image fills
  - mixed or complex paint stacks

If the system cannot evaluate it reliably, it says so. No fake certainty. No "looks compliant" theater.

**Accessibility tooling should reduce false confidence, not create it.**

## What's new in v2.0.0

- Contrast Inspector with on-canvas preview and gradient-aware checks
- Light and dark modes with six readable accent themes
- Templates for common checklist scopes
- Markdown export with WCAG level coverage summary
- Avatar activity tracking from real check and uncheck actions
- Refreshed UI and faster performance

Under the hood, this release also hardens the foundation:

- Variable-first design-system guardrails and baseline checks
- WCAG contrast automation scripts and nearest safe shade-step suggestions
- Runtime contrast-safe accent resolution for themed UI states
- Canonical variable imports and cleanup of legacy alias paths

## Guided checklist, not automated audit

This is a guided checklist, *not* an automated audit.

It is built for real teams doing real reviews, in the file, with shared context visible in Figma and FigJam.

That distinction matters. A ratio alone is not a full accessibility decision. You still need people, judgment, and explicit boundaries around what the tool can and cannot assert.

## Why I keep tightening this

***Accessibility is personal for me.*** I have been the eyes and ears for my legally blind and deaf brother for decades. I have watched him burn time on sites that do not care.

That is why I built this, and why I keep tightening it.

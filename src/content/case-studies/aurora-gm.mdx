<CaseStudySection title="The Challenge">
  <div className="space-y-6">
    <CaseStudyParagraph>
      General Motors had 4 distinct automotive brands--Chevrolet, Buick, GMC,
      and Cadillac--each with separate design and development teams building
      their own digital experiences. This fragmentation created:
    </CaseStudyParagraph>
    <CaseStudyMutedList className="space-y-3">
      <li>Duplicated effort across teams building similar components</li>
      <li>Inconsistent user experiences across GM's digital ecosystem</li>
      <li>No centralized accessibility strategy or component compliance</li>
      <li>Slow release velocity due to repeated work</li>
      <li>Knowledge silos preventing cross-team collaboration</li>
    </CaseStudyMutedList>
    <CaseStudyParagraph>
      The goal was ambitious: create a unified design system that could serve
      all 4 brands while respecting their unique brand identities, embedding
      accessibility from the ground up, and dramatically increasing development
      velocity.
    </CaseStudyParagraph>
  </div>

<CaseStudySection title="The Solution">
  <div className="space-y-6">
    <CaseStudyParagraph>
      I led the design and implementation of <strong>Aurora</strong> --GM's first
      cross-brand design system--serving as the single source of truth for React
      components across web and native platforms.
    </CaseStudyParagraph>

    <CaseStudySubheading>Cross-Brand Component Architecture</CaseStudySubheading>
    <CaseStudyMutedText>
      Built a theming system using design tokens that allowed 60% of components
      to be shared across all 4 brands, while the remaining 40% could be
      customized per-brand through token overrides. This meant teams could:
    </CaseStudyMutedText>
    <CaseStudyMutedList className="space-y-2">
      <li>Import core Aurora components that worked out-of-the-box</li>
      <li>Apply brand-specific themes via token swaps (colors, typography, spacing)</li>
      <li>Extend components only when brand-specific behavior was needed</li>
    </CaseStudyMutedList>

    <CaseStudySubheading>Token Pipeline Automation</CaseStudySubheading>
    <CaseStudyMutedText>
      Designed and built automated token workflows that synced design tokens
      from Figma Variables through Style Dictionary into React and React Native
      codebases. This removed manual handoff steps and ensured design-code
      consistency across all 4 brand teams.
    </CaseStudyMutedText>

    <CaseStudySubheading>WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance</CaseStudySubheading>
    <CaseStudyMutedText>
      Embedded accessibility into every component from day one. All Aurora
      components shipped with:
    </CaseStudyMutedText>
    <CaseStudyMutedList className="space-y-2">
      <li>Proper ARIA patterns and semantic HTML</li>
      <li>Keyboard navigation and focus management</li>
      <li>Screen reader testing with NVDA and JAWS</li>
      <li>Color contrast validation (4.5:1 minimum for text)</li>
      <li>Automated accessibility testing in CI/CD pipeline</li>
    </CaseStudyMutedList>

    <CaseStudySubheading>Storybook-Driven Development</CaseStudySubheading>
    <CaseStudyMutedText>
      Built comprehensive Storybook documentation for every component,
      showcasing all variants, states, and accessibility features. This became
      the central hub for designers, developers, and QA to reference Aurora's
      capabilities.

<CaseStudySection title="Technical Implementation">
  <div className="space-y-6">
    <CaseStudySubheading className="mt-0">Multi-Platform Library Strategy</CaseStudySubheading>
    <CaseStudyMutedText>
      Unified React and React Native component library strategy that increased
      release velocity by 30%. Components were architected to share core logic
      while platform-specific rendering was handled through adapters.
    </CaseStudyMutedText>

    <CaseStudySubheading>Token Governance Rollout</CaseStudySubheading>
    <CaseStudyMutedText>
      Opened Rosen Studio and established naming conventions, modes, and
      approval rules to keep tokens consistent at scale. Implemented semantic
      token structure (primitive -> semantic -> component tokens) that gave teams
      flexibility while maintaining brand consistency.
    </CaseStudyMutedText>

    <CaseStudySubheading>Team Enablement</CaseStudySubheading>
    <CaseStudyMutedText>
      Trained and onboarded 50+ engineers and designers on Aurora adoption,
      reducing onboarding time by approximately 40%. Created workshops,
      documentation, and office hours to ensure smooth adoption across all
      brand teams.

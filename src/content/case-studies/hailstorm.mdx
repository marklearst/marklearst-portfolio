<CaseStudySection title='The Challenge'>
  <div className='space-y-6'>
    <CaseStudyParagraph>
      Hailstorm is the Abusix design system. The original system shipped real
      UI, but the stack had fallen behind modern React patterns, token
      workflows, and accessibility expectations. The goal was not a rewrite for
      its own sake. It was to modernize the foundation without breaking product
      teams.
    </CaseStudyParagraph>
    <CaseStudyMutedList className='space-y-3'>
      <li>Legacy tooling made it hard to evolve components safely</li>
      <li>Tokens existed but lacked a clear, enforceable workflow</li>
      <li>Storybook docs did not reflect the actual production APIs</li>
      <li>Accessibility defaults needed to align with WCAG 2.2 AA</li>
      <li>QA coverage was fragmented and hard to trust</li>
    </CaseStudyMutedList>
    <CaseStudyParagraph>
      The modernization had to keep API stability while upgrading the stack to a
      2026-ready baseline: React 19, Tailwind v4 tokens, Storybook 10, and
      consistent automated tests.
    </CaseStudyParagraph>
  </div>
</CaseStudySection>

<CaseStudySection title="The Solution">
  <div className="space-y-6">
    <CaseStudyParagraph>
      I rebuilt the Hailstorm foundation as a React 19 component library with
      token-driven styling, Storybook-first documentation, and accessibility
      defaults baked into every primitive. This fork is maintained by Mark
      Learst and focuses on long-term system health.
    </CaseStudyParagraph>

    <CaseStudySubheading>Token-Driven Foundations</CaseStudySubheading>
    <CaseStudyMutedText>
      Tailwind v4 tokens now define the visual system, keeping themes consistent
      and changes predictable.
    </CaseStudyMutedText>
    <CaseStudyMutedList className="space-y-2">
      <li>Semantic token naming for color, spacing, and typography</li>
      <li>Single source of truth for component styling</li>
      <li>Token pipeline designed for long-term governance</li>
    </CaseStudyMutedList>

    <CaseStudySubheading>Storybook as Source of Truth</CaseStudySubheading>
    <CaseStudyMutedText>
      Storybook 10 + MDX docs are the canonical reference for component usage,
      variants, and accessibility behavior.
    </CaseStudyMutedText>
    <CaseStudyMutedList className="space-y-2">
      <li>MDX docs aligned with actual component APIs</li>
      <li>Visual QA and interaction states documented in one place</li>
      <li>Design token guidance lives alongside component examples</li>
    </CaseStudyMutedList>

    <CaseStudySubheading>Accessibility-First Primitives</CaseStudySubheading>
    <CaseStudyMutedText>
      Hailstorm uses Headless UI primitives and WCAG 2.2 AA defaults to ensure
      keyboard, focus, and ARIA patterns are correct out of the box.
    </CaseStudyMutedText>
    <CaseStudyMutedList className="space-y-2">
      <li>Keyboard interactions and focus management baked in</li>
      <li>Semantic HTML first, ARIA only when needed</li>
      <li>Accessible patterns documented and tested</li>
    </CaseStudyMutedList>

<CaseStudySection title="Technical Implementation">
  <div className="space-y-6">
    <CaseStudySubheading className="mt-0">Modernized Build + QA</CaseStudySubheading>
    <CaseStudyMutedText>
      The system now ships with Rollup builds, Vite for local development, and a
      modern test stack that covers logic and interactions.
    </CaseStudyMutedText>
    <CaseStudyMutedList className="space-y-2">
      <li>React 19 + TypeScript for stable component contracts</li>
      <li>Rollup for library builds, Vite for local dev speed</li>
      <li>Vitest + Testing Library + Playwright browser mode for QA</li>
      <li>Storybook 10 for docs, visual QA, and design review</li>
    </CaseStudyMutedList>

    <CaseStudySubheading>Core Workflow</CaseStudySubheading>
    <CaseStudyMutedText>
      The repo ships with a predictable loop for docs, tests, and builds.
    </CaseStudyMutedText>
    <CodeBlock
      language="bash"
      analyticsLabel="hailstorm_workflow"
      code={[
        "pnpm storybook",
        "pnpm test",
        "pnpm run build",
      ].join('\n')}
    />

    <CaseStudySubheading>Token Location</CaseStudySubheading>
    <CaseStudyMutedText>
      Tokens live in <code>src/styles/index.css</code> and are referenced in
      component styles so updates stay centralized.
    </CaseStudyMutedText>
